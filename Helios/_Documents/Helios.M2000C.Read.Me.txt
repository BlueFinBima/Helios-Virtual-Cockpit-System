Known issues
------------
	* Fuel Panel
	   - the Fuel CrossFeed Switch doesn’t work
	   - the two toggle switches don’t work (seems not to be used in DCS)
    * Master Caution lights Panel
	   - seems the id is not the good one when clicking on the 2 indicators ?
	* Landing Gear Panel
	   - removed the Guard for the "fly by wire gain switch". Still an issue due to the orientation of the guard. Need to click into the NonClickableZone zone to close it.
	   - the emergency landing gear lever : it seems there is nothing coming from DCS and need to work a little on the RotarySwitch in CompositeVisual.cs
	* PCA Panel
	   - the red Gun Arm Switch, the click is reversed
	* PCN Panel
	   - the Parameter selector doesn’t work from Helios to DCS
	* TACAN Panel
	   - the 2 switches to change the X/Y Mode and the Mode are not working from Helios to DCS
	   - the 2 switches to change the TACAN frequency are not implemented
	   - the display of the channel X/Y mode displays nothing
	* Miscellaneous Panels
	   - I don’t know how to test the Fire Warning Indicators. Does someone has a match? :-)
